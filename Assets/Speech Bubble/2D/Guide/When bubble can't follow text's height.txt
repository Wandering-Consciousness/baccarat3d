It is possible bubble can't follow text's height as new lines added up,
It happens when font's line height ignores floating point

Try adding 10 to 20 lines in bubble and see if it looks great

if not, adjust "heightRevision" in Manager

if bubble is slightly smaller, try +0.1
if bubble is slightly bigger, try -0.1 until bubble wraps text's height right

Arial font works fine with 0 revision but,
when you use new font you might have to adjust this value accordingly
