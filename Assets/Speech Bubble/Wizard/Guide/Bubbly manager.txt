Bubbly manager is only for 2D bubble users

It generates font's width set to be used when expanding speech bubbles on runtime

When you start you'll see bubbles expanding
If texts are staying nicely inside bubbles then click Set button
if not, adjust width at below text field then Click the button
If you are not sure the width you have typed in is indeed correct,
try the width +1 and -1 then you will see it right away

At the end, text file is generated then you can stop the scene
To use the text file, you need to reimport it by
for example, opening the folder of your project and coming back to editor
